Question 3
When conducting a usability study, the researchers decide to record their findings in a debriefing meeting after the session. Is this the best way to collect their observations?
1 / 1 point
 
Yes. This is a widely used data collection method. Researchers can collect and synthesize their observations directly after the session. 
 
No. It is important to record the usability study session. Researchers can use a paper note sheet, screen recorder, video recorder, or audio recorder. 
 
Maybe. It depends on the research goals. Researchers can record the sessions, or collect their observations directly after the session. 
Correct
Recording sessions makes it easier to turn observations into insights later, but participants will need to be aware of this process.
4.

1 / 1 point
 
Question-and-answer method
 
User-first method
 
Think-aloud method
 
Shared-ideas method
Correct
With the think-aloud method, researchers ask participants to explain what they’re doing while they’re completing tasks.

1 / 1 point
 
Participants may be confused about how to confirm, verify, and reserve a parking space
Correct
In row 4, two of the four respondents confirmed they had issues when completing the confirm, verify, and reserve process, so this may indicate a pattern. This is a trend in the data. 
 
Participants are able to locate a parking space using the "Reserve a Space" feature
Correct
In row 1, four respondents agree with this comment, so this may indicate a pattern. This is a trend in the data. 
 
Participants may be confused about how to locate a parking space using the "Reserve a Space" feature

outliers in the data 
 
research team opinions
 
design best practices 
Correct
Insights are strongest when they apply to multiple study participants, instead of just one. 
7.
Question 7
Consider the following scenario: 
A researcher is prioritizing insights from a usability study of an online learning app. The researcher identifies a common theme: When users complete a test, they click submit, but they are unable to verify submission until the instructor grades it. How should the researcher prioritize this issue? 
1 / 1 point
 
This is a P0 issue since users feel tricked by the submission feature
 
This is a P1 issue since this feature request does not impact the app’s functionality
 
This is a P1 issue since users cannot complete the user flow
 
This is a P2 issue since it requires back-end updates, which delay the timeline
Correct
This is a P0 issue that must be fixed. It is a top priority to ensure users do not feel deceived or tricked.
8.

This should not be selected
Please review the reading that covers usability study best practices.
 
A user needs to manually scroll through snapshots in the “add photo” feature, but would prefer an animated gallery 
 
A user needs to manually select the input language on the “translate post” feature, but would prefer automatic language detection 
9.
Question 9
Before testing a prototype, why is it important for a designer to confirm that the app meets specific platform requirements? Select all that apply.
1 / 1 point
 
To design an experience that aligns with platform conventions
Correct
Before conducting user testing, designers should confirm that the app meets platform conventions. If an app is being designed for Android devices and platform-specific interactions, the team shouldn’t expect iOS users to easily navigate it.
 
To align with a designer’s platform of preference
 
To meet the expectations of users on the platform
Correct
Before conducting user testing, designers should confirm that the app meets platform conventions. If an app is being designed for Android devices and platform-specific interactions, the team shouldn’t expect iOS users to easily navigate it.

A user needs to manually select the input language on the “translate post” feature, but would prefer automatic language detection 
Correct
A P1 issue may impact the user experience, but it does not stop a user from completing the main flow. A user preference, or feature request, is typically a P1 issue.
 
A user clicks the back button on the website, and the button does not respond
 
A user needs to manually scroll through snapshots in the “add photo” feature, but would prefer an animated gallery 
Correct
A P1 issue may impact the user experience, but it does not stop a user from completing the main flow. A user preference is typically a P1 issue.
